# Tasks: Physical AI Book

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/physical-ai-book/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required)

**Tests**: This feature is documentation-centric, so formal automated tests are not applicable at this stage. Verification will be manual through Docusaurus build and navigation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase to enable a clear development flow.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Phase] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Phase]**: Which development phase this task belongs to (e.g., P1 for Setup, P2 for Content Development, P3 for Review)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Docusaurus Setup Tasks

**Purpose**: Establish the foundational Docusaurus structure for the book.

- [x] T1.1 [P] [P1] Create the directory: `docs/physical-ai-book`
- [x] T1.2 [P] [P1] Create `_category_.json` with label "The Embodied Mind" and position: `docs/physical-ai-book/_category_.json`
- [x] T1.3 [P1] Update `sidebars.js` to include the new `physical-ai-book` category as an autogenerated item.
- [x] T1.4 [P] [P1] Create placeholder `chapter1.md` file: `docs/physical-ai-book/chapter1.md`
- [x] T1.5 [P] [P1] Create placeholder `lesson1-bits-to-atoms.md` file: `docs/physical-ai-book/lesson1-bits-to-atoms.md`
- [x] T1.6 [P] [P1] Create placeholder `lesson2-sensors-and-perception.md` file: `docs/physical-ai-book/lesson2-sensors-and-perception.md`
- [x] T1.7 [P] [P1] Create placeholder `lesson3-actuators-and-action.md` file: `docs/physical-ai-book/lesson3-actuators-and-action.md`
